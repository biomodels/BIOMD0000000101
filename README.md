# Model Notes


The model reproduces Fig 5A of the paper. The ligand concentration is
increased from 3E-5 to 0.01 at time t=2500 to ensure that the system reaches
steady state. Hence, the time t=0 of the paper corresponds to t=2500 in the
model. The peak value of the active ligand receptor complex is off by a value
of 1.25, the authors have stated that this discrepancy is due to the fact that
the figure in the paper corresponds to a slightly different parameter set. The
model was successfully tested on MathSBML.
